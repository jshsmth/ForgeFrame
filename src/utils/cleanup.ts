 * Manages cleanup tasks for proper resource disposal in a LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) order.
 *
 * @remarks
 * The CleanupManager provides a centralized way to register and execute cleanup tasks,
 * ensuring resources are properly disposed of when components or processes are torn down.
 * Tasks are executed in reverse registration order (LIFO), which is appropriate for
 * nested resource allocation patterns.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const cleanup = new CleanupManager();
 *
 * // Register cleanup tasks
 * cleanup.register(() => console.log('First registered, last executed'));
 * cleanup.register(() => console.log('Last registered, first executed'));
 *
 * // Execute all cleanup tasks
 * await cleanup.cleanup();

   * @remarks
   * If cleanup has already been performed, the task is executed immediately
   * rather than being registered. This ensures late-registered tasks are
